Client side of a MERN project

The backend part could be found <a href="https://github.com/YellowFlash2012/zuixihuandifang-server.git">here</a>

Project scope: This project is inspired by Maximilian MERN udemy course on .
It's about a simple app that allows users to signup, login, upload info, inclusing an image, about places they like or have visited, edit those info later on or simply delete a place from their profile.
The whole thing was eventually deployed as a combined app.

Tech Stack: react, react-router v6, 

Key learning points:
1- how to switch between login and signup form in the same component
2- how to use some react hooks like useCallback
3- how to fetch data from the backend with proper settings for the headers and body
